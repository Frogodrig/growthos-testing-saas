PH-001,"Replace Mock Action Layer","Replace stub services in /packages/action-layer with real integrations: Email via Resend or SendGrid, Calendar via Google Calendar API, Billing via Stripe Subscriptions, Webhooks via real webhook handler. Constraints: Keep integration minimal, do not abstract prematurely, maintain tenant isolation, log every external action. Deliverables: Email actually sends, meeting actually books, Stripe subscription activates tenant, metrics update correctly. NOT in scope: new agents, new workflows, UI, scaling optimizations, core engine changes.",integration,Completed,none,"INTG-001,INTG-002,INTG-003,INTG-004,INTG-005,INTG-006,INTG-007",2026-02-13T08:30:00.000Z,2026-02-13T11:15:00.000Z
PH-002,"Multi-Tenant Activation Layer","Implement tenant subscription lifecycle: POST /tenant/create endpoint, Stripe customer creation, Stripe webhook listener for subscription events, subscription activation toggle, tenant status enforcement middleware. Constraints: No complex role system, one owner per tenant in v1, tenant isolation at DB level only. Deliverables: New tenant can subscribe, subscription enables SaaS access, canceling subscription disables access. NOT in scope: multi-role auth, team invitations, admin dashboards.",backend,Completed,"PH-001","ACTV-001,ACTV-002,ACTV-003,ACTV-004,ACTV-005",2026-02-13T08:30:00.000Z,2026-02-13T11:25:00.000Z
PH-003,"Production Deployment","Deploy all 3 SaaS to production: Backend to Railway/Render/Fly, Postgres to managed DB, Redis to managed Redis, secrets stored securely. Each SaaS must have its own domain, use same shared backend infra, log production errors. Constraints: Do NOT optimize infra, do NOT autoscale, do NOT overconfigure. NOT in scope: CI/CD pipelines, monitoring dashboards, load balancing, CDN.",infrastructure,Planned,"PH-001,PH-002","",2026-02-13T08:30:00.000Z,2026-02-13T08:30:00.000Z
PH-004,"Manual Activation Mode","Temporary experiment configuration (14-day traction testing). Modify subscription activation flow to allow manual enabling of tenants without Stripe, while preserving all existing Stripe code and lifecycle structure. Add PAYMENT_MODE env flag (manual|stripe, default stripe). When manual: Stripe webhook activation bypassed, subscription defaults to pending, access denied until admin manually activates via POST /internal/activate-tenant (protected by ADMIN_SECRET). Stripe code NOT deleted — only conditionally bypassed. Dashboard shows 'Manually Activated' label when in manual mode. Constraints: No business logic changes, no agent logic changes, no scoring behavior changes, no Stripe code deletion, no architectural redesign. NOT in scope: Razorpay integration, new billing UI, automated billing alternatives.",security,Completed,"PH-002","MACT-001,MACT-002,MACT-003,MACT-004,MACT-005",2026-02-14T07:50:00.000Z,2026-02-14T09:30:00.000Z
